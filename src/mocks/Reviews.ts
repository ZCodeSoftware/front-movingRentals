      'So what an experience I was with my girlfriend now, the 5 time In Tulum and I have to say we tried almost every rental service but this rental service is by far the best experience I can give you my word that you will not be unhappy if you choose this rental service. they are honest Professionals and deliver more than you could ever expect. For example, one time we had a flat tire in the middle of the road And minutes later, a mechanic Came and solved the problem and didn’t even ask for money Or a tip, of course we gave him a tip😉. And also the people that are working for this rental service For me from Now on buddies I’m looking forward for next year Not only for the holiday in Tulum but also to meet the boys again just amazing thanks',

Easy to rent, bike was great quality, zero issues getting my deposit back and they even rescued my bike when some idiot double locked it to the bike rack within 20 minutes of me reporting the issue.

Their equipment and pricing are the best in town and they are super accommodating and trustworthy! They came to our hotel to drop off the ATV and pick up so we didn’t have to pay a taxi or worry about transportation. Everything was so smooth and organized, Nico and Bill we’re so cool, easy to interact and communicate with! They made our Tulum experience so much better with local recommendations and we saw way more outside of town then we would’ve been able to by bicycle. Thanks so much guys, we will be back!',

      'We came in initially thinking about renting a couple of bikes, but after seeing the traffic and distance to beach, we rented a scooter. After spending time in town then time at beach, we decided to just keep the scooter overnight and took to our hotel which was 20kms away. We asked Rosse and she said no problem! The next day we asked Rosse if we could keep another day and she was very accommodating so drove to Akamal to see the turtles. It was a fun way to explore and much cheaper than getting taxi’s everywhere. The communication was great and she has lots of tips for us on what to do and see.\nWithout fail I will be coming here again when back next year.',

We rented them for 3 days, but after the first day we wanted to change the bikes to a scooter, which they immediately agreed to. The day after we went and picked up the scooter, which was really good service.\n\nThe only bad thing we have to say is that the bicycles didn’t have any lights, therefore it was not safe to ride in the evening.\n\nBut overall we were really happy for the scooter and their service, and also they offer fair prices compared to other rental companies.',

      "Great customer service, somethings didn't go right on my first trip so the team went out of their way to make it up to me. I rented both an ATV and scooter. I recommend the scooter, it's faster and better for the regular streets. If going off-road then of course the ATV is better. Cops might stop you at a checkpoint and try to get money from you because you don't have all the paperwork for the vehicle just call Tulum Moving Rentals and they will handle it.",

      'Rented a scooter for 2 and had a great experience. Amazing service, the staff was super kind. The scooter performed great, we did more than 50km and consumption was super low. No hidden fees, flexible hours for renting. Would definitely recommend them!',
